## Introduction

Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers immense potential for financial empowerment, but its complexity and privacy concerns often create barriers for many users. StealthFi addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive platform that combines AI-driven investment advice with robust privacy mechanisms and on-chain automation. We believe everyone should have access to the benefits of DeFi, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Problem Statement

The DeFi landscape is currently plagued by several key issues:

- **Complexity:** Navigating the various protocols, understanding yield farming strategies, and managing wallets can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Users are often hesitant to share sensitive financial information on public blockchains due to privacy risks. Traditional methods of income verification often require revealing sensitive data.
- **Lack of Automation:** Executing DeFi transactions often involves multiple steps and technical knowledge, making it time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Information Overload:** The sheer volume of information and constantly evolving nature of DeFi makes it difficult for users to stay informed and make sound investment decisions.

StealthFi directly addresses these problems by simplifying DeFi access, prioritizing user privacy, automating complex tasks, and providing personalized, AI-driven insights.

## Key Features

- **Private and Secure:** Your sensitive financial data is encrypted and stored on private Nillion nodes, ensuring complete confidentiality.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-proofs):** Verify your income without revealing the actual figures, maintaining your financial privacy.
- **AI-Powered Investment Advice:** Receive personalized DeFi investment recommendations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **On-Chain AI Agent:** Execute DeFi transactions directly through natural language prompts, simplifying complex interactions like wallet creation, token transfers, and NFT minting.
- **Informational Chat:** Get answers to your DeFi, blockchain, and market-related questions through an AI-powered chat interface.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Connect your wallet seamlessly using the Reown appkit SDK and navigate the platform effortlessly.

## User Flow

1.  **Wallet Connection:** Connect your wallet securely using the Reown appkit SDK.
2.  **Income Verification:** Enter your income (above the threshold) and generate a zk-proof using SNARKs (Circom and Groth16) to verify it without revealing the exact amount.
3.  **Investment Preferences:** Set your investment preferences, which are then encrypted and stored privately on Nillion nodes.
4.  **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Our AI agent analyzes your preferences and provides personalized DeFi investment recommendations.
5.  **Chat-DeFi:** Ask questions about DeFi, blockchain, and market trends using the AI-powered chat interface.
6.  **Agent-Chat:** Use natural language prompts to instruct the on-chain AI agent to perform DeFi tasks, such as creating wallets, receiving tokens from faucets, sending tokens, and minting NFTs.

## Technology Stack

- **Wallet Integration:** Reown appkit SDK
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Circom, snarkjs, Groth16
- **Private Data Storage:** Nillion
- **AI Agents:** Covalent AI agents, Coinbase AI AgentKit, GAIA/Hyperbolic LLMs (EigenLayer AVS)
- **Data Retrieval:** Covalent Goldrush APIs
- **Blockchain:** (Specify the blockchain(s) used, e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
